        <h1 class="header">Coding</h1>
        <div class="text">

            <p>Coding is really fun and
               I like it so far.
               some languages I'm interesed in are:
            </p>
            <ul> 
                <li>python</li>
                <li>javascript</li>
                <li>c++</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm really interested in robotics,
               so i've been learning c++ for a while.
               I can't wait until to go to finish
               highschool and go to college for
               computer science, but that's a while
               from now.
            </p>
            <p>Today is my first day learning html,
               css and javascript. Since I have some
               experience programming already, quora
               and reddit says learning this should
               be a walk in the park! However, i'm
               still learning!

        <div class="text art-container">
            <div class="justified-text">
                <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/t0t0t0/art/Andy-769721841">
                    <img class="art" src="art.png" height="812" width-"375">
                </a>
                <p>I like drawing and making things
                   asthetically pleasing to me, like
                   this website!
                </p>
                <p>My whole life, i've been unfairly
                   praised for being good at drawing.
                   I think i'm closer to average,
                   because I see people all the time
                   online who are so much better than
                   I am. I don't feel bad about it though,
                   even if i'm comparing myself to others,
                   I take inspiration from it instead of
                   intimidation, and I know that if i'm
                   dedicated, I can draw like them someday!
